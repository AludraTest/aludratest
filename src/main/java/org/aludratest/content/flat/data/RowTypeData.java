/**
 * Row type recognizer for the BeanFlatFileReader.

 * until one of them returns a {@link Class} for signaling that 
 * it has recognized the row type. Then the reader uses the 
 * data annotations of that class for determining the column 
 * formats, parsing the row, instantiating an object of the class 
 * and setting its attributes, JavaBean properties or {@link Map} 
 * entries accordingly.
 * The user is free to choose a single RowType that recognizes 
 * all row types of a flat file format, one RowType for each 
 * bean class or an individual mapping.
