= Test Filter Syntax =

As described under [[Run a test]], you can specify ''dynamic'' filter criteria to determine which test classes to execute.

The filter string is usually configured within your Apache Maven <code>pom.xml</code>.

This is the syntax of these filters, in '''BNF''':
<code>
 Filter             ::= AndFilter OrFilterList
 OrFilterList       ::= EOF | '|' AndFilter OrFilterList
 AndFilter          ::= AttributeName Comparison AttributeValueList AndFilterList
 AndFilterList      ::=  | ';' AndFilter AndFilterList
 AttributeName      ::= Identifier
 Comparison         ::= '=' | '!='
 AttributeValueList ::= AttributeValue
                        | '(' AttributeValue AttributeValues ')'
 AttributeValues    ::=  | ',' AttributeValue AttributeValues
 AttributeValue     ::= Identifier
</code>

For an <code>Identifier</code>, all characters except <code>,;()=!|</code> are valid.

A valid filter would be:

 author=(jdoe,mmiller);status!=(Draft,InWork);testgroup=UAT|status=Approved
 
Note that spaces are ignored and only kept within identifiers (so an identifier cannot begin or end with a space).

So this would result in the same filter:

 author = (jdoe, mmiller  );status!=(Draft,  InWork ) ; testgroup =UAT   | status =Approved

To refer to the fact that a given attribute is not present in a class, use <code>[]</code> as attribute value, e.g.:

 author=(jdoe,mmiller,[])
This refers to all classes having jdoe or mmiller as author, or no author attribute set at all. <br/><br/>

 status!=(Draft,InWork,[])
This includes only test classes '''not''' having the status attribute set to Draft or InWork. Classes without a status attribute are '''also''' excluded (note that, if the [] would not be listed in the filter, these classes would match the criterion ''not Draft nor InWork'').
