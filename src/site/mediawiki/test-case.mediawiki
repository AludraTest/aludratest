== Test Case ==

A test case describes the flow of actions and verifications that shall be performed.

The test case itself is similar to junit.

A test class has to derive from <code>org.aludratest.AludraTestCase</code> and represents the lowest level test suite.

The test case (behavior) is represented by a public method (test method) annotated with <code>@org.aludratest.testcase.Test</code>.

The test method can be annotated with a (data) <code>@Source</code>.

The framework will run each test method as often as the corresponding Source has data sets.

Additional setup and tear-down code can be placed into public methods annotated by <code>@Before</code> respectively <code>@After</code>. 

Example:
<code>
 import org.aludratest.testcase.After;
 import org.aludratest.testcase.AludraTestCase;
 import org.aludratest.testcase.Before;
 import org.aludratest.testcase.Test;
 
 public class MyTestClass extends AludraTestCase {
 
   @Before
   public void setUp() {
       System.out.println("setUp() runs before every test method...");
   }
 
   @After
   public void tearDown() {
       System.out.println("... tearDown() runs after every test method.");
   }
 
   @Test
   public void myTestWithoutData() {
   	logInfo("myTestMethod was called");
   }
   
   @Test
   public void myTestWithData() {
   	logInfo("myTestMethod was called");
   }
   
 }
