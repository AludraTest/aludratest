== Create a test case ==

AludraTest use y syntax similar to junit.
* a test class shall extend '''org.aludratest.AludraTestCase'''
* a test method has to be annotated with '''org.aludratest.testcase.Test'''

A minimal test case would be:
<code>
  import org.aludratest.AludraTestCase;
  import org.aludratest.testcase.Test;
 
  public class MyTestClass extends AludraTestCase {
 
    @Test
    public void myTestMethod() {
      logInfo("myTestMethod was called");
    }
  }
</code>

=== Set-up and tear-down methods ===

Often, certain functionality has to be invoked before (set-up) or after (tear-down) test execution. This can be achieved by putting relevant code into particular methods. Such methods have the following requirements:

* be '''public'''
* do not be '''static'''
* have return type '''void'''
* have a '''@Before''' (set-up) or '''@After''' (tear-down) annotation

Any test class may have several methods marked with @Before or @After, also inherited methods are executed.

If a test class has several test methods, each @Before method is called before each test method and each @After method after each test method.

Extended example:
<code>
 import org.aludratest.testcase.After;
 import org.aludratest.testcase.AludraTestCase;
 import org.aludratest.testcase.Before;
 import org.aludratest.testcase.Test;
 
 public class MyTestClass extends AludraTestCase {
 
   @Before
   public void setUp() {
     System.out.println("setUp()");
   }
 
   @After
   public void tearDown() {
     System.out.println("tearDown()");
   }

   @Test
   public void myTestMethod() {
     logInfo("myTestMethod was called");
   }
   
   @Parallel // force the data sets to run parallel
   @Source(uri="testSource.xls", segment="sheet1") 
   public void testTestWithData(Date date, int value) {
     System.out.println("testWithData() " + date + ", " + value);
   }
 }
