=== Excel Collection Mapping ===

==== Example Model ====

Imagine a DataClass model with the classes Country, State and City, interrelated with Java collections:

==== DataClasses ====

The model above is implemented with the following classes:

<code>
 public class CountryData extends Data {
 	
    private String id;
    private String name;
    private List<StateData> states = new ArrayList<StateData>();
 
    public String getId() {
        return id;
    }
 
    public void setId(String id) {
        this.id = id;
    }
 
    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }
 
    public void setName(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }
 
    public List<StateData> getStates() {
        return states;
    }
 
    public void setStates(List<StateData> states) {
        this.states = states;
    }
 }

 public class StateData extends Data {
 
    private String id;
    private String name;
    private List<CityData > cities = new ArrayList<CityData >();
 
    public String getId() {
        return id;
    }
 
    public void setId(String id) {
        this.id = id;
    }
 
    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }
 
    public void setName(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }
 
    public List<CityData > getCities() {
        return cities;
    }
 
    public void setCities(List<CityData > cities) {
        this.cities = cities;
    }
 }

 public class CityData extends Data {
 
    private String name;
 
    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }
 
    public void setName(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }
 }
</code>

==== Excel Sheet Mapping ====

Data of such a recursive collection mapping can be represented in Excel documents in the following manner:

# Create a 'country' tab with columns 'id', 'name' and 'states'
# In the country tab, create one row for each country, entering id and name data as usual
# For each country create a dedicated Excel tab that contains all states of the country, e.g. named 'states_de', with the columns 'id', 'name' and 'cities'
# In the country tab, declare the tab name containing the related data, entering 'tab:' followed by the tab name in the 'states' cell
# In the states tab, create one row for each state in the related country and create cities tabs for enumerating the cities



==== Excel Sheet Example ====

As an example one can map the following hierarchy

 Germany           (Country)
 +- Bayern         (State)
 |  +- München     (City)
 |  +- Regensburg  (City)
 +- Hessen         (State)
   +- Kassel      (City)
   +- Wiesbaden   (City)
 
 Italy             (Country)
 +- Veneto         (State)
 |  +- Verona      (City)
 |  +- Venezia     (City)
 +- Lomabardia     (State)
   +- Milano      (City)
   +- Bergamo     (City)

<br/>using this Excel document structure (having all the tabs in the same Excel document):

==== Data Consumption in a Test Case ====

When consuming this data in an AludraTest method like this:

<code>
 @Test
 public void testInbound(@Source(uri =  "country.ent.xls", segment = "countries") CountryData country) {
    System.out.println(country.getName());
 }
</code>

The test method is executed twice, once with country Germany, once with country Italy having them wired with all their states and cities.

=== Skipping initial Rows in an Excel Sheet ===

When certain data sets of an Excel sheet require further examination, one can temporarily configure the test method to skip the first n rows, applying the annotation org.aludratest.annotations.test.Offset to the test method, for example for skipping the first 5 data rows:

<code>
 @Test
 @Offset(5)
 public void test(@Source(uri = "myfile.ent.xls", segment = "mytab") MyData data) {
    ...
 }
</code>


=== Generating Excel Documents ===

AludraTest provides a feature to generate Excel documents based on a test method's signature and annotations. There is a GUI and a command line version that allows you to create an Eclipse run configuration for generating Excel documents:

==== Excel Generation GUI ====

The Excel Generation GUI is tarted by launching the main class '''org.aludratest.app.excelwizard.ExcelWizard'''. It scans the current project folder for (already compiled) AludraTest test cases and displays them in a list.

Using a filter text, the user can filter the test cases by substring:

<br/>[[Image:Excel-wizard.png]]

<br/>When selecting a test case from the list, the 'Test Method' dropdown box is updated to display all test methods that have @Source annotations.

The user can then select one and click 'Create Excel Sheet'. The wizard will then create an empty Excel sheets that contains a 'config' tab and data tabs that reflect the structure of the annotated method parameters:

==== Excel Generation in Eclipse ====

For generating Excel documents in Eclipse, first create a "Java Application" run configuration that uses the project which contains the test class and set the main class to '''org.aludratest.app.excelwizard.CLIExcelCreator'''.

On second tab "Arguments", in the field 'Program Arguments' enter ${java_type_name}.

In order to execute the generator, select the test class in the Eclipse package explorer and start the new Run Configuration.
